# Mixed Messages
## A project on CodeCademy

This is a project in JavaScript to return 3 messages randomly (each message is a single entity and is random).
The theme I have chosen for this is Life Tips - tips to make the most out of life

Planning:
Create three different arrays, each one with 10 tips.
Create a function that takes a random tip from each array and logs it to the console

Testing the commit
