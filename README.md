## Mixed Messages
### A project on CodeCademy

This is a project in JavaScript to return 3 messages randomly (each message is a single entity and is random).
The theme I have chosen for this is Life Tips - tips to make the most out of life.

The file in GitHub contains all it needs to run, you just need to run it.

The source code contains comments to explain the code.

* Enjoy! *
